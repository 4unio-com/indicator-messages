2012-08-21  Lars Uebernickel  <lars.uebernickel@canonical.com>

	Merge lp:~larsu/indicator-messags/towards-q-redesign
	
	This branch introduces libmessaging-menu, a new library for applications to
	integrate with the messaging menu. Libindicate is not supported anymore.
	
	libmessaging-menu uses GMenuModel to communicate with
	indicator-messages-service.  In order to take advantage of GMenuModel's
	architecture (re-exporting menus on a different path), the service now also
	sends its menu as a GMenuModel to the panel plugin.
	
	The plugin uses gtk_menu_new_from_model to create the menu widgets.  Custom
	menu items are created by a small gtk+ patch that watches for x-canonical-type
	attributes.
	
	The branch also contains most of the design changes for quantal.

2012-08-21  Lars Uebernickel  <lars.uebernickel@canonical.com>

	Show icons in application and source menu items
	
	Everthing goes through GIcon now, using g_icon_{to,new_for}_string to set a
	string attribute on the menu item.  The attribute is prefixed x-canonical- for
	now.

	least "Clear" is below the app items now.

	Export both static shortcuts also when the app is running

2012-08-20  Lars Uebernickel  <lars.uebernickel@canonical.com>

	Use a custom menu item for application items
	
	This introduces ImAppMenuItem: a menu item which shows a small triangle next to
	an application's name if the associated app is running.
	
	The running state is communicated to the menu by giving the "launch" action a
	boolean state.
	
	This depends on a patch to gtk which creates custom menu items from
	gtk_menu_new_from_model when the x-canonical-type attribute is set on a menu
	item in the model.

	X-MessagingMenu-UsesChatStatus --> X-MessagingMenu-UsesChatSection

2012-06-28  Lars Uebernickel  <lars.uebernickel@canonical.com>

	libmessaging-menu: use the (newly added) GTupleAction instead of GSimpleAction
	
	GTupleAction is a bit simpler to handle when the action state contains a tuple
	of things that are independently modified most the time.  It might be useful
	for other indicators as well.
	
	This implicitly also fixes the bug that libmessaging-menu did not preserve the
	other values in the action state when updating count, time, or string.

2012-06-27  Lars Uebernickel  <lars.uebernickel@canonical.com>

	Only show chat section when necessary
	
	The chat section is only shown when an application that is registered to use it
	is running.  Applications are registered if their desktop file contains:

	Regression: accessible description

2012-06-27  Lars Uebernickel  <lars.uebernickel@canonical.com>

	Add toplevel menu
	
	The toplevel menu represents the indicator itself.  It has one item with a
	submenu, which is the indicator's popup menu.  The action that is set on the
	toplevel will never be activated, but its state is used to indicate
	"draws-attention".

	Add GActionMuxer
	
	This is a new implementation of an action muxer with the same interface as the

	because it doesn't need to implement GActionObservable.
	
	In addition to muxing different action groups with the <prefix>.<action_name>
	scheme, it has the notion of global, prefix-less actions.  Indicator-messages
	needs those for the status and clear actions.

	Use a gsettings list for finding out which apps should appear in the menu
	
	Previously, this was handled by looking for .desktop files in various system
	and user directories.  The messaging menu should not display any applications
	by default anymore, so a simple per-user gsettings list suffices.  A neat side
	effect is that the hairy blacklist handling is not needed anymore, either.
	
	Small regression: apps are not configurable at runtime anymore (settings key is
	not listened to for changes).

2012-05-18  Lars Uebernickel  <lars.uebernickel@canonical.com>

	Remove the seen db
	
	It was only really used to figure out whether one of the default apps was ever
	running, so that "Set up..." or the app name and actions would be shown in the
	menu.  Since there are no default apps anymore, this is not needed either.

2012-05-18  Lars Uebernickel  <lars.uebernickel@canonical.com>

	Remove default applications
	
	This gets rid of the "Set Up <app>" sections for Email, Chat, and Broadcast.
	Also, default apps don't get to override the icon and names anymore.  Every app
	gets its real name and icon displayed.  Overriding the icon with
	X-Ayatana-Messaging-Menu-Icon is still possible.

	Merge lp:~larsu/indicator-messages/lp956147 to fix broken thunderbird message indicator icons.
	
	This is a refinement to r254, which set an empty icon so that shortcut labels ("compose new message", "contacts", etc.) are horizontally aligned with the labels of the applications they belong to. Apparently gtk2 sets a "broken" icon onto a GtkImage if gtk_image_set_from_icon_name() is passed an empty string, which caused the behavior seen in bug #956147. Adding an #ifdef is a short-term fix for removing that "broken" icon in gtk2 for 12.04.

2012-03-14  Lars Uebernickel  <lars.uebernickel@canonical.com>

	Use basename of the desktop file as key in the blacklist hash table
	
	This is superior to using symlinks, as this also allows copying the desktop
	files into the blacklist directory. Copying is the default when dragging and
	dropping an application into that folder.

2009-09-04  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Oops, a little silly before.  We really need to check the indicators as well, we can't just clear the attention for the count value.

2009-09-04  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Reworking how we handle the server count changing and how that makes us check for attention now.

2009-09-04  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Ask for all the properties up front.

2009-09-04  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	We're tracking count instead of whether we should show the time as a boolean.

2009-09-04  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Making the sender support the name attribute and clean up the code a bit.

2009-09-04  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	oops forgot to remove type from the modified one, oops.

2009-09-04  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Well, you know, Oholoh says that I don't comment enough.  Better put some more in.

2009-09-04  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

2009-09-04  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	We have to drop show_time as a parameter as the caller doesn't really know if that's the case or not anymore.

2009-09-04  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Reshuffle.  Now the creation of an indicator makes for a im-menu-item without looking at type and subtype at all.  We'll have a bunch more now.

2009-09-04  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	libindicate dependency was already 0.2.0, but marking this as the case in the version history.

	Adding a little style to our labels.  Hopefully making them look a little nicer.

2009-08-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in teh ability to count the number of launchers that are visable

2009-08-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	The documentation clearly states that you don't need these if the client supports introspection.  I thought I was being old school by still putting them in.  But, THE DOCUMENTATION LIES, you need to add the signals no matter what.

2009-08-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Forgot to change to Ayatana

2009-08-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Oh, wow, now there's some flesh on these.  Let's hide and show icons.

2009-08-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Relinking back to trunk.

2009-08-21  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	The launcher creation didn't test to see if it already exists.  Now we keep one launcher per desktop file.  Makes sense, eh?  That's what we're going for.

2009-08-21  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Start responding to changes in the applications directories

2009-08-21  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	I'd have to say that hash_table_find didn't do what I expected, and is pretty useless.

	Now parsing the directory on start up.  Getting this whole thing started up.

	Writing the fairly extensive and complex check function.  But, if that's the way it needs to be, I guess it needs to be that way.

2009-08-20  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	We're taking ownership of that variable as well

2009-08-20  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Fleshing out the add function.  Just a little.

2009-08-20  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

2009-08-20  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Use a GDK app context.  Not sure about the timestamp units though.

2009-08-19  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Oh, some debug messages to see what's going on.

2009-08-19  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Ah, where casting kills.  You can cast anything to the right value even though it's not.  Nice opaque errors you get for that.

2009-08-19  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Big commit.  Trying to check for eclipses, but first both objects needed to track their desktop file paths.  So I had to add that little nugget in as well.

	Adding the launcher list to the resorting function.  This looks more complex than it is, it's just merging the two lists on the fly in alphabetical order.

2009-08-19  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Making this file a little more readable.  Eh, I guess you never plan on them getting this big when you start do you?  I remember when he was just a little automake file.

2009-08-19  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Missing a couple headers for distcheckness

2009-08-19  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>
